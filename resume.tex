\GapNoBreak
\BulletItem
Use \CodeCommand{section} and \CodeCommand{subsection} to create sections and subsections.
These will appear in the PDF bookmarks too.

\GapNoBreak
\BulletItem
This is the second \CodeCommand{BulletItem}.
Long items are automatically indented.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

This is a \CodeCommand{SubBulletItem}.
Long items are automatically indented.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Sed sed aliquam massa.
Aliquam dignissim mi non enim feugiat elementum.
Donec sit amet turpis ac velit ultrices volutpat.
Aliquam vitae elit massa.
\SubBulletItem
This is the second \CodeCommand{SubBulletItem}.
\SubBulletItem
The \CodeCommand{SubBulletItem}'s are between
\CodeCommand{begin\{detail\}} and
\CodeCommand{end\{detail\}} so that they are typeset in a smaller font.
\end{detail}

\Gap
\BulletItem
This is the third \CodeCommand{BulletItem}.

\Gap
\BulletItem
A \CodeCommand{Gap} or \CodeCommand{GapNoBreak} is inserted between the \CodeCommand{BulletItem}'s so that there is a small vertical space between them.
The ``NoBreak'' version prevents page breaking, and should be used to avoid orphaned headings and other formatting issues.

\textbf{Usage Notes}

\GapNoBreak
\BulletItem
New Lines and Paragraphs
\begin{detail}
\SubBulletItem
To create a new line within the same paragraph (i.e., with the same indentation), use \CodeCommand{newline} instead of \CodeCommand{\textbackslash}.
The latter will not work because it breaks the long table.
\SubBulletItem
To create a new paragraph, use \CodeCommand{par} or simply leave an empty line.
Paragraph indentations (from
\CodeCommand{Item},
\CodeCommand{SubItem},
\CodeCommand{BulletItem},
\CodeCommand{SubBulletItem},
etc.) do not carry across different paragraphs.
\end{detail}

\Gap
\BulletItem
Vertical Spacing Between Items
\begin{detail}
\SubBulletItem
Use \CodeCommand{Gap} or \CodeCommand{GapNoBreak} to insert a small vertical space between items within the same section.
\SubBulletItem
Use \CodeCommand{BigGap} or \CodeCommand{BigGapNoBreak} to insert a bigger vertical space between items within the same section.
\SubBulletItem
The ``NoBreak'' versions prevent page breaking.
\end{detail}

\Gap
\BulletItem
Dates
\begin{detail}
\SubBulletItem
Use
\CodeCommand{DatestampYMD\{YYYY\}\{MM\}\{DD\}},
\CodeCommand{DatestampYM\{YYYY\}\{MM\}}, and
\CodeCommand{DatestampY\{YYYY\}}
to specify dates.
\SubBulletItem
Change the definition of \CodeCommand{DatestampFormatSelection} to adjust how dates are displayed throughout the document (e.g., ``\mbox{2010-12-31}'', ``\mbox{Dec 2010}'', ``\mbox{December 2010}'', ``\mbox{2010}'').
