\GapNoBreak
\BulletItem
New Lines and Paragraphs
\begin{detail}
\SubBulletItem
To create a new line within the same paragraph (i.e., with the same indentation), use \CodeCommand{newline} instead of \CodeCommand{\textbackslash}.
The latter will not work because it breaks the long table.
\SubBulletItem
To create a new paragraph, use \CodeCommand{par} or simply leave an empty line.
Paragraph indentations (from
\CodeCommand{Item},
\CodeCommand{SubItem},
\CodeCommand{BulletItem},
\CodeCommand{SubBulletItem},
etc.) do not carry across different paragraphs.

\Gap
\BulletItem
Vertical Spacing Between Items
\begin{detail}
\SubBulletItem
Use \CodeCommand{Gap} or \CodeCommand{GapNoBreak} to insert a small vertical space between items within the same section.
\SubBulletItem
Use \CodeCommand{BigGap} or \CodeCommand{BigGapNoBreak} to insert a bigger vertical space between items within the same section.
\SubBulletItem
