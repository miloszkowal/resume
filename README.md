# Resume

This is my resume. I keep it on GitHub as a means of keeping myself and others honest of my work history. I'm not going to put something on there and lie about it if it can easily be proven false. My commit history is my commitment to any prospective employer that while I do attempt to make my projects and positions sound as impressive as possible, they are truthful.
